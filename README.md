# FiniteOS
This project represents my learning journey and my OS development skills. I am a completely newcomer and simply a C/C++/Cybersecurity and, hopefully, OS dev enthusiast.

This project is not meant to be published/used commercially or in production settings.

## Documentation
I strive for complete documentation (relative to its implementation) with educational value that explains everything that I have learned and every resource I have used to implement that particular component of this kernel.

However, do not take the information presented in this repository at face value, always fact-check and *see appropriate documentation*.

After all, I am not a professional nor am I a computer scientist.

You can find the documentation under `Documentation/` directory.
